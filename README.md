# American-time-use-Data-Mining-
This project will analyse the data mining of demographic data in order to make classification
models which are capable of identifying individuals whose salary exceeds or is under a
specified value.The data used in this project was sourced from Bureau of Labour Statistics
provided by United states department of Labor collected with the help of surveys and the
responses by the american people.
This project will implement the CRISP-DM methodology where a comprehensive review of the
customer's requirements supports the creation of a business objective outlining items such as
the expected level of model performance. This will be used to create a data mining objective
which will guide the subsequent work in the data understanding, preparation and modelling
steps and the final evaluation and selection of a classification models.
The data mining objective is to create a classification model which can predict individuals whose
weekly salary exceeds or is under 1500 US dollars by mining survey data containing information
such as Employment Status, Education Level, Age-Range, Gender and the time spent on
different activities like sleeping, house work, watching television, caring of children, eating and
drinking, socializing, playing etc.
